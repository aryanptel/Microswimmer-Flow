In this project, I have calculated the asymtotic limit of the flow field of the microswimmer in the presence of hydrodynamic interaction.
Further, we have compared the far field limit of the flow field with the exact flow field. 
The motivation behind this calculation was to decrease the computational resource needed to simulate the dynamics of multiple microswimmer interacting with each other.
In the repository, you can find the calculations, the base research paper" "Tapan Chandra.pdf", and results.
